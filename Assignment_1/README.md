# Dataset Analysis using R/Python

This repository contains code snippets demonstrating basic data analysis operations using R and Python on given datasets.

## Operations:

### a) Summary Statistics:
Compute and display summary statistics for each feature available in the dataset. Summary statistics include minimum value, maximum value, mean, range, standard deviation, variance, and percentiles.

### b) Data Visualization:
Create a histogram for each feature in the dataset to illustrate the feature distributions. Histograms help visualize the distribution of data and understand its spread.

### c) Data Cleaning, Integration, Transformation, and Model Building:
Perform data cleaning operations such as removing duplicates and handling missing values. Integrate and transform datasets as necessary. Finally, build a data model, such as classification, using suitable algorithms.

## Dataset:
The dataset used for analysis is admissions dataset and is available in the repository.
