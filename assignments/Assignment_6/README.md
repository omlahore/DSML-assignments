# Assignment on Regression Technique

## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to apply linear regression to predict the month-wise temperature of India using temperature data.

## Dataset
Download the temperature data from the following link: [Temperatures of India Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/venky73/temperaturesof-india?select=temperatures.csv). This dataset contains the average temperatures of all places in India on a monthly basis, with temperature values recorded in Celsius.

## Tasks
a) **Apply Linear Regression:** Utilize a suitable library function to apply linear regression and predict the month-wise temperature.

b) **Assess Regression Model Performance:** Evaluate the performance of the regression models using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-Square metrics.

c) **Visualize Regression Model:** Visualize a simple regression model to understand the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.

## Conclusion
By completing this assignment, you will gain hands-on experience in applying linear regression, assessing model performance, and visualizing regression models.
